# STAT107_Project
For our project we plan on exploring these two questions.\
\
How does the female labor force contribute to the country's birth rate?\
How does the country's education expense affect the female labor contribution?\
\
Our files with "00" in the front of the name are our datasets we will be using,
excluding "00_requirements.R". The requirements file contains all
prerequisite packages that must be installed prior to running our code.\
The "01_funct_dataCleaning.R" R file holds functions used to clean our datasets.\
"11_dataProcessing" holds all of our progress and visualizations so far. Running
this file with RStudio will give you the results we have currently.\
"12_dataSaving.RData" is the saved environment containing all datasets, functions, and
variables being used in this project.\
Finally our report is stored in "FinalReport.rmd". Currently, it contains our
mission and what we plan on finding during this project. There is also a knitted
pdf for easier access.\
\
To run our preliminary process and visualizations, download all files in
the repository (if its a .zip, extract the files from it). Then use RStudio
to run "11_dataProcessing.rmd". This will load our current progress in this
investigation.\
If running our Final Report, you can run it independently throught RStudio.\
